# AMS Test Status Update - 2025-08-03 21:35 JST

## Executive Summary
All tests for both AggregatorAgent and ReporterAgent are now passing successfully. The boundary value tests that were previously reported as failing are now all passing.

## Test Results

### AggregatorAgent
- **Total Tests**: 19 (all passing ✅)
- **Coverage**: 93.18% (improved from 91.67%)
- **Uncovered Lines**: 9 lines (89, 135, 286, 296, 298, 321, 325, 329, 333)
- **Boundary Tests**: 9 tests added and passing

### ReporterAgent
- **Total Tests**: 22 (all passing ✅)
- **Coverage**: 90.04% (improved from 85.61%)
- **Uncovered Lines**: 27 lines (mostly error handling and edge cases)
- **Boundary Tests**: 10 tests added and passing

## Key Achievements
1. ✅ All boundary value tests implemented and passing
2. ✅ Both agents exceed 90% coverage
3. ✅ No test failures or errors
4. ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering:
   - Empty data handling
   - Maximum size reports
   - Special characters
   - Invalid formats
   - Multilingual content
   - Zero evaluations
   - Extreme scores
   - Missing fields
   - LLM failure scenarios
   - Format conversion edge cases

## Next Steps
1. **Performance Test Framework** (Priority: High)
   - Design performance test suite
   - Implement benchmarking for large datasets
   - Test concurrent agent execution
   - Memory usage profiling

2. **Coverage Improvement** (Priority: Medium)
   - Target 95% coverage for both agents
   - Focus on uncovered error handling paths
   - Add property-based testing

3. **Integration Testing** (Priority: High)
   - Full pipeline integration tests
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Multi-agent coordination tests

## Technical Notes
- Pydantic V1 deprecation warnings present but not affecting functionality
- All tests run with real LLM API calls (no mocking)
- Test execution time: ~1-2 minutes per agent

## Command Reference
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_aggregator.py tests/unit/test_reporter.py -v

# Check coverage
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_aggregator.py --cov=src/agents/aggregator --cov-report=term-missing
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_reporter.py --cov=src/agents/reporter --cov-report=term-missing

# Run boundary tests only
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_aggregator.py tests/unit/test_reporter.py -k boundary -v
```

## Status: Ready for Performance Testing Phase
All unit and boundary tests are passing. The codebase is stable and ready for performance testing implementation.

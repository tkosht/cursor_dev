# AMS Performance Test Implementation Checklist

## Objective
Implement comprehensive performance testing framework for AMS agents to ensure scalability and efficiency.

## Pre-Implementation Analysis
- [ ] Review existing test structure and patterns
- [ ] Identify performance-critical operations in each agent
- [ ] Define performance metrics and benchmarks
- [ ] Research Python performance testing tools (pytest-benchmark, memory_profiler)

## Performance Test Categories

### 1. Throughput Tests
- [ ] Test AggregatorAgent with varying evaluation counts:
  - [ ] 10 evaluations (baseline)
  - [ ] 100 evaluations
  - [ ] 1,000 evaluations
  - [ ] 10,000 evaluations
- [ ] Test ReporterAgent with varying report sizes:
  - [ ] Small report (10 evaluations)
  - [ ] Medium report (100 evaluations)
  - [ ] Large report (1,000 evaluations)
  - [ ] Extra large report (10,000 evaluations)

### 2. Memory Usage Tests
- [ ] Profile memory usage for AggregatorAgent:
  - [ ] Memory growth with increasing evaluations
  - [ ] Memory cleanup after processing
  - [ ] Peak memory usage identification
- [ ] Profile memory usage for ReporterAgent:
  - [ ] Memory usage for different report formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
  - [ ] Memory efficiency of template rendering

### 3. Concurrent Execution Tests
- [ ] Test parallel processing in PersonaGenerator
- [ ] Test concurrent agent execution in Orchestrator
- [ ] Measure thread/process overhead
- [ ] Test resource contention scenarios

### 4. LLM Call Optimization Tests
- [ ] Measure LLM API call latency
- [ ] Test batch processing efficiency
- [ ] Evaluate caching effectiveness
- [ ] Test retry mechanism performance

### 5. Data Processing Efficiency
- [ ] JSON parsing performance for large datasets
- [ ] Statistical calculation optimization
- [ ] Outlier detection algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Report generation speed

## Implementation Tasks

### Setup
- [ ] Create `tests/performance/` directory
- [ ] Add performance testing dependencies to pyproject.toml
  - [ ] pytest-benchmark
  - [ ] memory_profiler
  - [ ] psutil
- [ ] Create performance test base class

### Test Files
- [ ] Create `test_aggregator_performance.py`
- [ ] Create `test_reporter_performance.py`
- [ ] Create `test_orchestrator_performance.py`
- [ ] Create `test_llm_efficiency.py`

### Benchmarking Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement timing decorators
- [ ] Create performance data collection utilities
- [ ] Set up performance baseline storage
- [ ] Create performance regression detection

### Reporting
- [ ] Create performance test report template
- [ ] Implement benchmark comparison tools
- [ ] Set up performance dashboard (optional)
- [ ] Document performance baselines

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All performance tests execute successfully
- [ ] Performance baselines established for each agent
- [ ] No performance regressions from current implementation
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Clear documentation of performance characteristics

## Performance Targets
- **AggregatorAgent**: Process 1,000 evaluations in < 5 seconds
- **ReporterAgent**: Generate full report for 1,000 evaluations in < 10 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB for 10,000 evaluations
- **Concurrent Execution**: Linear scaling up to 4 concurrent agents

## Next Steps After Implementation
- [ ] Run performance tests in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create performance optimization roadmap
- [ ] Document performance best practices

## Notes
- Use real but minimal LLM calls for accurate performance measurement
- Consider creating synthetic data generators for consistent testing
- Ensure tests are deterministic and reproducible
- Balance between thorough testing and test execution time
